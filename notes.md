### Possible features
- build maker + compare builds
- fixa support? 
  - yeah, not going to happen.
- complete bp calculator 
  - if the class growth rates are not predictable, this one will be really hard to do.
  - Too much data than I'd to store in memory. 
  - (8 classes * 40 level * 4 stats (BP, hp, atk, def) = 1280))
  - ...unless?
